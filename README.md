# Redux Chess- An [isomorphic](http://nerds.airbnb.com/isomorphic-javascript-future-web-apps/) online chess app

Built on top of Node.js, Express, React, and Redux. (Build system uses Webpack, Babel, and BrowserSync.)

This is an unfinished project. Eventually this app will allow multiple people to play chess online but it currently only supports single-player.
